# BDD API Test with SpecFlow, xUnit, and RestSharp. Used https://reqres.in/

This project demonstrates API testing using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles with SpecFlow, xUnit, and RestSharp. The tests are structured in a BDD style, allowing easy collaboration and automated API testing.

## Overview

This repository contains tests for various API endpoints, structured using SpecFlow for BDD. The test scenarios are written in Gherkin syntax and are implemented using SpecFlow step definitions. The tests are executed using xUnit as the test runner, and RestSharp is used for making HTTP requests to the API.

Key features of this project:
- BDD-style tests using SpecFlow.
- API request handling using RestSharp.
- Test logging using xUnit's `ITestOutputHelper`.

## Technologies Used

- **SpecFlow**: A BDD framework for .NET to define the scenarios and automate the tests.
- **xUnit**: A testing framework for .NET to run the tests and generate reports.
- **RestSharp**: A popular HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Newtonsoft.Json**: For serializing and deserializing JSON in HTTP requests and responses.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- **.NET SDK**: Ensure that the latest version of the .NET SDK is installed on your machine. You can check this by running:
  ```bash
  dotnet --version
  ```
- **Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code**: You can use either of these IDEs to open and edit the project.

### Install Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the project folder and restore the NuGet packages:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

This will install the required packages listed in the `.csproj` file.

### Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- **StepDefinitions**: Contains SpecFlow step definitions that match the scenarios written in Gherkin.
- **ApiBaseStep**: A base class for common API testing logic (such as sending requests and handling responses).
- **Features**: The folder where your `.feature` files containing the BDD scenarios are stored.

## Usage

### Writing Scenarios

BDD scenarios are written in `.feature` files using Gherkin syntax. Here's an example of a simple feature file:

```gherkin
Feature: Get User Details API

  Scenario: Get user by ID
    Given the user sends a get request with url as "https://reqres.in/api/users/2"
    Then the request should be a success with 200 status code
```

### Step Definitions

Step definitions are written in C# and map to the steps in the feature file. For example:

```csharp
[Given(@"the user sends a get request with url as ""(.*)""")]
public void GivenTheUserSendsAGetRequestWithUrlAs(string url)
{
    SendRequest(url, Method.Get);
}

[Then(@"request should be a success with (.*) status code")]
public void ThenTheRequestShouldBeASuccessWithStatusCode(int expectedStatusCode)
{
    var response = (RestResponse)_scenarioContext["Response"];
    _output.WriteLine("Get Response Content: " + response.Content);

    if ((int)response.StatusCode != expectedStatusCode)
    {
        throw new Exception($"Expected status code {expectedStatusCode}, but got {(int)response.StatusCode}");
    }
}
```

### Customizing the Requests

You can add additional headers, query parameters, or modify the request body in the `SendRequest` method. This method is used for making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

## Running the Tests

You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
dotnet test
```

This will execute all the test scenarios and show the results in the terminal.

If you want to run the tests using Visual Studio, simply open the project, build it, and run the tests via the Test Explorer.

## Test Output and Logs

The `ITestOutputHelper` in `AllApiUserTest` is used to log the response content, status codes, and request bodies for better visibility when running the tests. The logs will appear in the test output.

Example log output:
```
Post Body Content: { "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in", "password": "cityslicka" }
Post Response Content: {"error":"Missing email or username"}
Post Response Status Code: 400
```
